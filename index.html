        The horizontal, rectangular orientation of this scenic book painting provides a comfortable window for its portrayal of a landscape. A series of three border lines separate it from the text that accompanies the painting on the full page; two thin orange lines on the outside, one medium black line in the middle, and directly surrounding the painting, a golden brown border. The painting is  strictly illustrative and does not include text—it depicts a layered mountain range; trees throughout the background and foreground, and a distinct coastline separating a large body of water on the bottom third of the painting. Five shades of color are primarily used, including blues, browns, and greens as coloring, black for linework, a saturated orange in detailing, and white mainly present in negative spaces. The painting is a distinctly stylized, mountain range painted in curved, swooping arches and each hill decorated with repetitive linework of circles and semicircles. The mountains mainly alternate between the colors blue and brown—a dusty, medium shade of blue and a warm, orange-toned shade of brown. Many of the mountains’ black lined borders have tiny, black dashes sticking outwards creating a hairy, or grassy effect. Contrast in the mountains is achieved through variation in coloring techniques and additions of linework detailing. Some of the mountains have a gradient coloring, with a highly saturated border which fades out to unpainted white negative space when approaching the edge of another mountain. Others have repeating painted stripes of color running parallel to the contour of the mountain or thin black line work creating ornate details in the shapes of spiraling circles, semicircles, and dots. 
Furthermore, the presence of trees in the painting adds variation in the overall composition of the piece. In the background behind the mountain range, two large trees stand mostly in the center of the entire painting, but slightly to the right. The tree on the left has stringy, bushy leaves painted with cross hatching, while the tree on the right seems to be a different species, with smaller leaves painted in bunches of four or five brush strokes. At the base of the two trees behind their trunks is a patch of long, green grass, and three flowery stems reaching upwards. There are two other small tree groves depicted in the painting. They exist along an imagined horizontal line going through the middle of the painting. On the left, there are four smaller trees, alternating between the bushy, crosshatched leaf-tree and the leaf-bunch trees. They are painted to fit the contour of the rolling mountains directly in front of and behind them, and also have a green patch of grass lining the edge of the mountain the trees are growing from. On the right side, there are four small, bushy trees also growing out of a line of grass along the edge of a mountain. Between each of these four small trees is a small, flowery stem slightly taller than the rest of the grass. 
The body of water depicted in the bottom third of the painting uses mainly shades of blue and light brown. Rolling waves are painted using a repetitive pattern of striped semicircles, fitting together to form engaging layers of waves. On some of the semicircles, the top stripe extends and forks into multiple curled patterns, representing crashing waves. The crashing waves are surrounded by small patches of solid blue and dotted with white circles, providing contrast to depict water droplets coming off the moving waves. Additionally, there are four figures of animals painted amongst the waves. On the right side, a pair of waterfowl resembling ducks or geese float atop the waves side by side. These birds are painted with a variety of colors, including blue, brown, and white on their bodies, and a saturated orange color on their beaks, eyes, breasts, and legs. There is black linework detailing the feathers, wings, tails on the birds, and an outline of the entire animal. On the middle-left side of the body of water are a pair of fish, painted in mid-motion on top of the surface of the water. The fish are painted with the same colors as the waterfowl, with some blues and browns on the body, and orange on the eyes, fins, and mouth. The fish are in a playful position, the one on the left arched in the shape of a “C,” and the other facing towards the arch of the “C.

        She marvels in her brimming saturation and begins to walk. Her feet leave an invisible imprint on the ground behind her. Her skin invites the noisy breeze. Her eyes are open, looking, yearning, engulfing her surrounding sights with a furious hunger. She fits in it at first and slips away soon after. Her mind is cold air on a hot day. Escaping from an icebox of piercing frigidity.
